## tilde.team goals and roadmap

### services

* mail
    - this is currently just forwarding addresses from google domains
    - you can send from @tilde.team addresses with gmail smtp
    - future state: tilde.team mailserver? webmail? local delivery mail?
* irc
* mastodon/activitypub social
    - [halcyon](https://halcyon.tilde.team) and [pinafore](https://pinafore.bhh.sh) clients
    - is it worth switching to pleroma? there is no good way to migrate, but it's significantly faster and lighter on resources
* forum - this project needs a lot of love (https://git.tilde.team/meta/forum) but it's got potential
* [github org](https://github.com/tilde-team)
* [gitea!!](https://git.tilde.team)
    - test the PAM auth module :)


### future plans

* ldap auth
* sshkey only
* disable password auth
* ~ben shouldn't be the single point of failure. need a way to pass command to another admin if i go MIA.
