# bsd.tilde.team

tilde.team offers an alternate host: [bsd.tilde.team](https://bsd.tilde.team), which runs freebsd 12.

currently it supports:

- webhosting out of `~/public_html` at `https://<user>.bsd.tilde.team` or `https://bsd.tilde.team/~<user>`
- email with user@bsd.tilde.team - feel free to forward this elsewhere or to your main @tilde.team address
- finger

the user creation script copied over the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file in your $HOME on ~team. feel free to adjust as needed or holler if you need an admin for something. you should be able to just ssh user@bsd.tilde.team instead of user@tilde.team

there's a [mailing list thread](https://lists.tildeverse.org/hyperkitty/list/tildeteam@lists.tildeverse.org/thread/LRLAYRTHJLFQWZAXZZW62GYQLW7S2WYC/) for discussion that i'll post updates to. feel free to holler in #team on irc as well.
