# tilde.team manifesto

> tilde.team is a shared system that provides an inclusive, non-commercial space for teaching, learning, practicing and enjoying the social medium of unix.


here are some of our most important values:

1. tilde.team is an alternative social environment for the technically-inclined; specifically, a non-commercial alternative to the mainstream, corporate-owned media and social media. we aim to put the users in control of the tools of communication that are currently being neutered by corporate commodification of the www. 

1. provide tools, resources and encouragement for users to develop ideas and best practices for the next generation of public access unix systems.  the "next generation" is always ahead of the present, so this implies that the system is in a constant state of development and self-improvement, with a continually rolling set of goals, and regular testing and evaluation of experimental projects. --all of which is powered by user involvement in a brainstorming/experimenting/teaching/learning/doing model.

1. serve partly as a meta-community among other tildes and pubnixes, both sharing best practices and learning from their experiences.

1. last but absolutely not least --> MAKE IT FUN!  it should not be a bitter place to sulk or rant about mainstream culture. it should be a social environment in which users can go wild and push their creative skills to the limit. it should be a place to appreciate what does not exist in other exploitative commercial environments.
