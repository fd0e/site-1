# tilde.team domains

because [~ben](https://tilde.team/~ben/) hoards domain names, the following domains are associated with tilde.team and/or the tildeverse somehow:

* [fuckup.club](http://fuckup.club) - alias
* [nand.sh](https://nand.sh/) - alias
* [ttm.sh](https://ttm.sh/) - url shortener
* [tild3.org](https://tild3.org/) - alias *note*: this is tentatively planned to be decommissioned
* [tilde.chat](https://tilde.chat/) - irc net
* [tilde.life](http://tilde.life/) - redirect
* [tilde.news](https://tilde.news/) - lobste.rs clone
* [tilde.ninja](https://tilde.ninja/) - alias *note*: this is tentatively planned to be decommissioned
* [tilde.pizza](http://tilde.pizza/) - redirect *note*: this is tentatively planned to be decommissioned
* [tilde.site](https://tilde.site/) - alias
* [tilde.wiki](https://tilde.wiki/) - alias of [tilde.team wiki](https://tilde.team/wiki/)
* [tilde.zone](https://tilde.zone/) - mastodon and related stuff
* [tildegit.org](https://tildegit.org/) - gitea
* [tilderadio.org](https://tilderadio.org/) - tildeverse radio
* [tildeteam.net](https://tildeteam.net/) - alias

* [tildenet.org](http://tildenet.org/) - redirect to tilde.chat *note*: this is tentatively planned to be decommissioned
* [tildeverse.net](https://tildeverse.net/) - the tildeverse! (registered due to impending .org price hikes)
* [tildeverse.org](https://tildeverse.org/) - the tildeverse!

aliases can be used as-is, where redirects will simply change to a tilde.team url.

note that redirects do not have ssl certs. if you have a cool project that could use one of the not sure or redirect domains, let me know.
