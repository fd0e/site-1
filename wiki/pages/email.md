# email


currently, tilde.team email is handled through our domain registrar, google domains. if you opted in to email forwarding when you signed up, the address you signed up with was added as the recipient of all mail sent to your username@tilde.team. 

if you want to send mail as your username@tilde.team, see [this support answer](https://support.google.com/domains/answer/3251241?hl=en) under the section for "sending mail from your forwarded address".

registrar forwarding isn't a great solution. i'd like to look into running a tilde.team mailserver with imap, smtp, and some slick local mutt and alpine setups. let [~ben](https://tilde.team/~ben/) know if you have any ideas or would like to help figure out a better solution here!
