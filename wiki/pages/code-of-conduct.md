## 2. tilde.team mission

[full goals/roadmap document](https://tilde.team/wiki/?page=goals-roadmap)

**tilde.team exists to foster an engaged community for socializing, learning, and making cool stuff**

in a mass-media age, it is up to small, intentional communities to gather and work together to provide a space outside of the advertising-laden, profit-seeking, corporate-owned world of social media.

to that end, tilde.team strives to be a radically inclusive community where people of all backgrounds and all technological experience levels can come together to learn, to teach, and to delight in one another's creations.


## 3. expected behavior

the following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

  * participate in an authentic and active way. in doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
  * exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
  * attempt collaboration before conflict.
  * refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
  * be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants.
  * teach when people need help. don't do it for them.


## 4. unacceptable behavior

the following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

  * violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
  * sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
  * posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
  * posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
  * personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
  * unwelcome sexual attention. this includes sexualized comments or jokes.
  * deliberate intimidation, stalking or following.


## 5. consequences of unacceptable behavior

unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority (sudo), will not be tolerated.

anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

if a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from tilde.team without warning (meaning your account will be terminated and all user data deleted).
