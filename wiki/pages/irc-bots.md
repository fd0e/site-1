## tilde.team irc bots

tilde.team is a place for socializing, learning, and making cool stuff. one fun activity for this is the creation of [irc](https://tilde.team/wiki/?page=irc) bots.

if you keep your bots clean and efficient, your irc bots are welcome on tilde.team.

bots should be well behaved and efficient with system resources. if you see a bot that is not, please remind the botmaster about this and/or notify an admin.  naughty bots can make the system less enjoyable for everyone, and we all have to work together to police them.

## rules and etiquette for tilde.team irc bots

your bot must respond to !botlist with the following information:
- bot name
- your system username (as creator/botmaster) - so we can contact you if the bot misbehaves
- one line description of the bot's functionality
- list of the bots public commands

be conservative about automatically re-connecting to the server or channel.

if your bot's code is not stable, keep it in the #bots channel and do testing there.

## add your bot to the list below
