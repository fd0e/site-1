# tildeblogs with [bashblog](https://tildegit.org/team/bashblog)

bashblog is available system-wide as `bb`

tildeblogs can be built with [bashblog](https://tildegit.org/team/bashblog)

change to your ~/public_html/blog directory: `cd ~/public_html/blog` (bashblog will do this for you if you forget)


---
## usage

1. `bb post`

1. write a post (it will open your preferred $EDITOR for you, so make sure it's set)

1. save, close, and then select from the bashblog menu choices


---

## advanced

edit the `.config` file to change the name and url and other settings for your blog

for an example of customization, see [~ben's blog](https://tilde.team/~ben/blog/) ([config source](https://tildegit.org/ben/tilde/src/branch/master/blog/.config)).

for more details: see [the bashblog repo](https://tildegit.org/team/bashblog)

of course, you're free to use any other blogging software :)
