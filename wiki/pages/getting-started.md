* On a PC, you'll need to get an ssh client. PuTTY is a good one.

Linux

Open a terminal. Try ctrl + alt + t.
ssh your_username@tilde.team
Enter your password.
Mac

Browse to Applications/Utilities/Terminal and launch Terminal (or press cmd+space, start typing Terminal, and press return)
ssh your_username@tilde.team
Enter your password.
Finding your index.html file
There are some basic command line commands you'll want to Google and learn, but for this tutorial you only need a few:

ls = list files and folders in current directory
cd = change directories
nano = a command line text editor
Type: ls to see where you are. You should see a directory called "public_html"
Type: cd public_html to move into that folder. (cd stands for change directory.)
Type: ls to see where you are. You should see your index.html file
Editing your index.html file
Type: nano index.html to open your index.html file and begin editing
Edit your file, willy nilly
When done editing, use ctrl + x to close the file
You'll be asked if you want to save; say y and to return to the command line
Refresh your tilde page in your browser to see your new website
Note: If at any time you feel you made a mistake in editing, you can exit and n to not save.
