## tildeverse irc

hi tildizens!

the tilde.chat irc network is available at tilde.chat:+6697 (with ssl)

this is the beginning of the [tilde.chat](https://tilde.chat) irc federation! more info on that site.

`#team`, `#town`, and `#your` are reserved channels for the local ircd nodes. you can only join those from the respective hosts.

if you're logged in with ssh, run `chat` to connect weechat directly.

local connections can use 6667 without ssl

there is an instance of [thelounge](https://thelounge.chat) webchat at [irc.tilde.team](https://irc.tilde.team) if you don't already have your own client.

run `webirc` to set up your account for [our webchat](https://irc.tilde.team)

the #meta channel on irc is bridged to #general on the [tilde.team discord](https://tilde.team/discord/) if you are already using discord.

hit me up on irc/discord if you have any suggestions!
