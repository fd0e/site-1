# [tildeverse irc](https://tilde.chat)

hi teammates!

the tilde.chat irc network is available at irc.tilde.chat:6697 (with ssl) as a round robin of 
[available nodes](https://tilde.chat/wiki/?page=servers).

this is the beginning of the [tilde.chat](https://tilde.chat) irc federation! more info on that site.

### here are some options to connect:

* `weechat` when logged in with ssh
* `irssi`
* [`znc`](https://znc.tilde.team/) - log in with your shell password and configure as needed
* run `webirc` to register your thelounge account for [our webchat](https://irc.tilde.team)
  note that thelounge does not authenticate with your shell password.
* any other client that you like: connect to our node at team.tilde.chat:6697 with ssl

local connections (weechat, irssi, znc) can use 6667 without ssl

for more info, see the [tilde.chat wiki](https://tilde.chat/wiki/) for info on bots and other specifics.
