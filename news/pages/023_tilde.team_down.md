hey hi everyone
just letting you lot know about why tilde.team was unreachable...
fosslinux kind of dun goof'd and ran nmap on the tilde.team machine, and of course, the host, Hetzner, didn't like that as it was against their ToS, and locked the IP. ~ben managed to get it resolved about... a day later? and *yay* we're back up! ~ben's said that he's gonna create a proper ToS now so look out for that.
later!

update 2: i've written a [article from my perspective](https://tilde.team/~fosslinux/blog/on-november-13th-i-made-a-bit-of-an-oops.html) ~fosslinux
