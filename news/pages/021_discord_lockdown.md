Due to recent events in the tilde.chat Discord server, we have decided to lock it and its accompanying IRC bridge until further notice. On Monday, the IRC to Discord bridge will be shut down and all channels in the tilde.chat Discord will be set to READ-ONLY. This decision will only be reversed when a full discussion has been held on moderation requirements, rules, and certain members of our moderation team who appear to be missing.
  
How this affects you:
* If you primarily use Discord, you will have to use IRC from now on. tilde.team users can use [our TheLounge instance](https://irc.tilde.team) for a Discord-like experience (or any other client of their choosing), whereas members of other tildes can continue using their tilde''s node in the tilde.chat network.
* If you primarily use IRC, all that changes is that you will not be able to use the tilde.chat Discord.</p></li>

The behavior of some users in the tilde.chat Discord has been unacceptable and does not comply with our code of conduct. Upon further review, we have decided that managing the Discord server is a bit more than we can handle without discussing moderation in-depth. As such, ben and I (khuxkm) have decided to make it READ-ONLY until we have come to a more permanent decision (which may be to close it permanently).

If you have any thoughts/ideas for the future of the discord bridge, please drop a line to ben or myself on IRC or by email (@tilde.team [or any of the other domains](/wiki/?page=email)). We can be found in the #sudoers channel.

Thanks for <del>flying tildeverse</del> being a member of the tildeverse and working with us to figure out a chat solution that works for everyone!
