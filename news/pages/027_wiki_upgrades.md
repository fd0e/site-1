it's been pretty quiet on the tilde.team lately. everything's humming along
smoothly in the background. irc has been the place to be. if you haven't
stopped by in a while, please do check in and say hi!

in other news, i was struck by inspiration today and finally sat down to
figure out how to get auto-linked headers on the wiki so that you can link
directly to a section by header.

give it a try!
