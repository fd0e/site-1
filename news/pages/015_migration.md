tilde.team is now on a beefy vps! 4cores, 6gb ram, and 100gb ssd space!

everything is where you left it, but you will get a scary notice about a man-in-the-middle attack when you connect over ssh. (this is just because the IP address changed). the new IP is 104.223.31.252 and the ECDSA fingerprint is: `SHA256:CoJQp1mGtYJOZscJul6Ba94o2NsuzZTUI/b76JLGy3A` for your verification purposes.


edit: it wasn't as stable as i thought... see [part 2](?page=020_migration_again)
