we're now running a [gopher server](/wiki/?page=gopher) and [http proxy](https://gopher.tilde.team)! connect to [gopher://tilde.team](gopher://tilde.team) or use [our http proxy](https://gopher.tilde.team) for when you don't have a gopher-capable browser handy

to get started in gopherspace, check out [gopher.zone](https://gopher.zone) or use [`bb`](https://tildegit.org/team/bashblog), [`feels`](https://github.com/modgethanc/ttbp), or [`burrow`](https://github.com/tilde-team/burrow) at the shell!
