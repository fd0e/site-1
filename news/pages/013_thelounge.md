i'm now hosting a [thelounge](https://thelounge.chat) instance on the tilde.team server. let me know if you want to use it and i'll add your user. i haven't figured out how to integrate the thelounge accounts with the tilde.team accounts, but i'm looking into it.

run `webirc` from your ~team shell to register.

it's up at [irc.tilde.team](https://irc.tilde.team)
