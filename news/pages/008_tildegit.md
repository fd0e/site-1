for some reason, i have this desire to run all kinds of self-hosted tools on the tilde box. i used to run a gitlab instance under my own personal domain, but it turned out to be way more work than it was worth. i had been interested by [gogs](http://gogs.io) in the past and stumbled upon the community fork [gitea](https://gitea.io), which is more up to date and full-featured. at this point, it's just some mirrored repos from my github page and the tilde.team org. let me know if you have any ideas for it!

it's up at [tildegit.org](https://tildegit.org)!
