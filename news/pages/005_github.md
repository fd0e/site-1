ICYMI, tilde.team has a github org for any projects that you may be working on! 
the source code for this [home page](https://github.com/tilde-team/site) is out there (the [theme](https://github.com/tilde-team/hacker-bootstrap) too), along with a few other repos.

edit: these now live on [gitea](https://tildegit.org/team) as [team/site](https://tildegit.org/team/site) and [team/css](https://tildegit.org/team/css)
